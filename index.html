          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Aging is a big factor in cognitive function. Much like the rest of the body, 
          the brain actually shrinks as you age.The most apparent age-related 
          cognitive change is memory.</p> 
          <p>You can keep your brain running smoothly by keeping it in shape, 
            the same way you do your body—play memory games, eat a healthy diet, 
            and wear hearing aids if you suffer from hearing loss! </p>

          <p>The greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and 
            premature death. Studies show that Americans at all income levels are less healthy
             than those with incomes higher than their own.Not onlyis income (the earnings and 
             other money acquired each year) associated with better health, but wealth
              (net worth and assets) affects health as well.</p>

          <p>Overweight and obesity may increase the risk of many health problems, 
            including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. If you are pregnant, 
            excess weight may lead to short- and long-term health problems for you
             and your child.</p>
             <p><strong>“To insure good health: eat lightly, breathe deeply, live moderately, 
               cultivate cheerfulness, and maintain an interest in life.” – William Londen</strong></p>
